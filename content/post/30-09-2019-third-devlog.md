Readings:

Poetic Terrorism and Art Sabotage
The readings that really engaged me this week were the two chapters on Poetic Terrorism and Art Sabotage. Both emphasize action over words or debate when retaliating against the ugly aspects of the status quo. It does appear, however, that there are a few differences between the two strategies. One is that PT disrupts and AS destroys. Another is that PT seems to target the average person as its audience, anyone who will understand what it is saying. AS, on the other hand, appears to be more “stick it to the man”-esque. The actions outlined in the chapter take direct action against those institutions that perpetuate ugliness. Additionally, PT’s tactics seem to favor nuance and subtlety, they are meant to be poetic, representational, and meaningful but they could go unnoticed if you didn’t understand what they were getting at. AS on the other hand, is more obvious and explicit. In this course and project, we are more likely to use the PT style of action in our guerilla history.

Digital Tinkering:

Taleblazer
Taleblazer seems much more complex than Twine. It looks like the sort of thing where once you get the hang of it, you could potentially build some very interesting and complex games. However, I have not yet gotten the hang of it. I perused the instructions and then tried to build a small game where you encounter a hungry squirrel of Carleton campus and then decide whether or not to give the squirrel an acorn. I think I will need to try to find some more in depth tutorials online before I can build anything more involved than that. I like that you can place the game within a specific geographical location. This would be much simpler than building the game through Twine and then linking the player to the atlas. Some more tinkering will definitely be necessary before I decide whether to build my final project using this resource.
