Finishing up

Although I am posting this devlog after the project has gone live, I will be talking about everything that led up to pressing that “Publish” button.  The past week or so has been filled with a lot of searching, uploading, and double guessing. As I continued to upload the sources to my map points, I started to think about whether the effect that I was going for was coming across. I think I began to revert back to my essay writing habits because I started to search for scholarly secondary sources to provide context and perspective to the primary sources. I especially wanted to add nuance to the On to Ottawa Trek as I realized that I had uploaded 4 newspaper articles condemning the trekkers with very little context and placed them directly in front of the Ottawa Mission. So, I found an abstract from an article describing why accessible housing is integral to public health to hopefully convey to the user why the trekkers were valid in their protest. 

Additionally, I decided to cut out the Marathon of Hope. I decided to cut it because for one, Terry Fox’s goal (unlike the other walks) was never to make it to Parliament or even to Ottawa. I felt that this hindered the effect that I was trying to create by amassing several walks that all ended at Parliament while having the user walk to Parliament themselves. Additionally, I was worried that I couldn’t do each walk justice while also keeping the amount of time it would take to complete the walk to a reasonable length. Cutting out one walk seemed to be a better option than cutting out more information on other walks. 

Overall, I am happy with the project. Some things that went unfinished were the transcriptions of the newspaper articles. I will be adding those in soon, as I will still need to transcribe them for the accessible/netlify version of the walk. I also never added in a “Further Reading” section at the end of the walk. Something that I have been thinking of doing is leaving some of the problematic things in the walk alone but addressing them, their causes, and their implications in my paradata. What I am hoping to do with that paradata is to make almost a “meta” version of my project that not only provides all of the information and resources necessary for someone who doesn’t have an apple device to access the walk, but also provides a deeper look into the project that almost inverts the issue of accessibility. Making it the people who only interact with the walk through an iOS that don’t have full access.
