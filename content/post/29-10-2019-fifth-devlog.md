A New Idea
I am considering a radical shift in this project. Until now, I have been working towards creating a game that complicated the narrative of confederation. However, last week I had an idea about the content of this project. I can't get this idea out of my head because it just seems to fit this project more elegantly than the confederation idea. The new idea is to create an exploration game in essentially the exact same style and using the same medium (Aris) as my previous idea but, in this version, explore a select history of the political walks/marches on Ottawa.
The huge, glaring, obvious issue with this idea is that we are well into the semester, with only 5 weeks until the project needs to be finished. Is this too late in the game to switch topics? One argument to discount this objection is that I will be using the exact same tech to accomplish this project as I would have with the last one. This therefore cuts down significantly on the amount of backtracking I might need to do, especially because I have primarily been working on the tech side of the project rather than the content side.
My next steps will definitely be to confer with Dr. Graham on this switch and to look into the research on this topic to see if there is enough substance on this topic to adequately fill out this project.
Walks that I want to look at are: the On-to-Ottawa Trek, the Nishiyuu Walkers, the recent Climate March, and perhaps one or two more.
I would set up points of information on the marches in areas relevant to wither the subject or route of the march. The points would not necessarily need to be followed in a particular order, however, I would like the exploration to eventually lead the user to Parliament. I would also, hopefully, like to infuse some discussion on the concept of using physical movement to symbolically "bring" issues to the government.
