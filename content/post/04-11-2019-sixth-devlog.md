Update on Project: Oral Report 2

This project has undergone some pretty radical changes since its first inception. To recap: the project will be using Aris to lead “users” on a journey through downtown Ottawa to Parliament while exploring the history of political walks, marches, and runs in Canada. Currently, I have just about completed research for two of the walks and I am investigating about 3 more. I have also begun to create a rough outline of the journey on Aris. 

Digitally, there is not much new to report on. I will be using Aris to create groupings of what are referred to as plaques. The plaques will contain either links to or pictures of primary source documents. Once the “user” has investigated all of the plaques for one particular walk, the grouping of plaques for the next will be unlocked.

Conceptually, there is a lot to talk about. I wanted to change up my content for this project because I felt that this topic would allow for a much richer discussion of the appropriate use of a medium for its content. In this project, I hope to explore the convergence between material and immaterial within historical investigation. On one level, we have the medium itself, a digital overlay (immaterial) of historical information on the physical cityscape (material). Allowing the “user” to both physically and conceptually move through history. Then on another level, we have the actual subject of the political walk in which people walk (material) to bring the social issue (immaterial) they are championing to parliament (material and immaterial). Additionally, I hope that this project will achieve a mirrored effect of a political walk. As political walks progress towards their destination, they typically pick up more walkers. However, in this experience the “user” or walker, in a sense, picks up political walks/movements. 

A lot of the ideas I am hoping to explore in this project were inspired by other work I have done in graduate school. I recently presented on theories of the study of material culture in Historical Theory and Method. In that presentation, there was a lot of discussion of the convergence between material and immaterial as well as the way that material objects create our perception of self and culture. Furthermore, it was from my research for my thesis that I was inspired to change my topic. I visited an exhibit at the Canadian Museum of History entitled Footprints – A Walk Through Generations, it was there that I was first introduced the Journey of Nishiyuu.

A key issue I am experiencing has to do with the tailoring of historical sources. I obviously cannot expect people to read through pages and pages of primary and secondary sources while walking around outside. However, by selecting a few short pieces of evidence to illustrate the context and events of each walk I worry that I am over-simplifying and potentially misrepresenting the issues each walk represents. A potential remedy might be to have a section at the end suggesting further reading on each topic that the “user” can then investigate at their leisure.
