Oral Report 3: Paradata

My process has largely been one of trial and error. I started out with a basic idea of what I wanted the user to experience: a progressive exploration of downtown Ottawa through repositories of historical information that allows the user to discover hidden narratives. Originally, I wanted to achieve this through a game centering on the assassination of D’Arcy McGee.

After determining what I wanted to achieve, I set about finding a digital platform that would be able to accommodate my goals for the project but still be within my skill level. I tried Twine and Taleblazer for the narrative structure. I also played around with the digital atlas for the placement of the repositories. Ultimately, I landed on Aris. It has quite a bit of flexibility in how you can construct your digital overlay of a physical space but it is still very easy to use. However, I have some issues with Aris. For example, it is only accessible through iOS (Apple devices) and so is not accessible to the general population. As we read in “Resistance in the Materials,” technologies and the information within them must be accessible, especially to under-represented groups. Additionally, by building my project on an Apple-exclusive platform, I am also in a way supporting the environmental and social impacts of Apple products.

Once I had decided on the digital technology that I was going to use for my project (and having tested it out), I began to think a bit more about how the tech shaped my subject. After some consideration and consultation with the London Charter, I decided that my subject did not suit the project I was trying to build. The murder mystery narrative just was not fitting into the platform as neatly as I had hoped. I had also had a random thought of another subject that I could not get out of my head. In September, I had visited the Canadian History Museum and saw an exhibit titled “Footprints” in which I learned about the Journey of Nishiyuu. My random thought had placed that journey to Ottawa right next to my exploration framework and it suddenly made so much more sense to change the subject to one of political walks, marches, and runs. Before, the idea of having the user walk around seemed a little forced. But with the subject being one of a political walk then the physical exploration of the city, augmented through the digital repositories of historical information, felt much more necessary to the experience. 

With my subject settled on, my next step was to dig in to the research. I picked five walks/marches/runs to have my users explore. They are the On to Ottawa Trek (1935), the Journey of Nishiyuu (2013), the We Demand Demonstration (1971), the Marathon of Hope (1980), and the Climate March (2019). I chose these five because they spanned a range of social issues, political climates, and time. They all also either came to or passed through Ottawa. With these walks chosen, I then had to decide what information would go in to the repositories. I did not want to impose any more of my voice than I already had simply by choosing these walks and so I decided against writing contextual panels. Instead, I have been placing primary and secondary sources in the repositories that will hopefully place the walks within their complicated contexts while allowing the user to form their own opinions about each issue. Additionally, by choosing some primary source documents that were produced by either the organizers or participants, I will hopefully avoid the issue of speaking for other people and instead provide a platform for them to speak for themselves. 

My next steps are to finish placing the documents in the platform and to test it. One potential problem I can foresee is if the pictures of the primary source documents are not large enough or high enough resolution to be easily read. I may need to include a plain text transcription of the sources if this is the case. I have also been considering creating some sort of video walk-through or even a revisiting of the digital atlas that I can post on my github so that the information is not being gate-kept by an iOS system.
