Much of the work I did this week was taking stock of what skills and technologies have learned so far in this course, rocnicling them with my goals for the project, and then organizing them to chart out my next steps. This was all done in preparation of the first oral report due in class this week. I have included below a summary of that report. Below that summary are my notes on the tinkering I did on Aris which is a comparable technology to Taleblazer.

Goal of project:
Have player question whether Canada is actually the great of a country

My story:

-I want to complicate the confederation narrative and get the players to make their own opinion about it

-Thinking of using the assassination of D’Arcy McGee as a hook into the investigation
	
  -Have the player go around downtown interviewing historical figures and looking at historical documents
		
    -Interview John A. MacDonald at parliament, look at documents at the national archives
	
  -Idk if I want to have it set in the time period or current day
		
    -If set in time period it would be more of a true murder mystery type game
		
    -If set in the present day it would be more of an historical investigation – pull in scholarly materials, get around anachronisms
			
      -It would be cool to make the player question how much of the game is real, maybe even prompting them to look for confirmation and start their own investigation
			
      -Maybe using meta-narratives to make them question the sources?
			
      -Help them develop an historian’s skill set (critical thinking, identifying narratives, evaluating sources, etc.)

-My idea is that they start out thinking that they will just be looking at McGee but as more evidence and sources pop up as they progress through the game world, they start to get side tracked and uncover larger narratives that have been sidelined (MacDonald’s racism, the fact that parliament is on unceded Algonquin territory, women can’t vote)

Mechanics:

-Having a game type mechanic where the player explores downtown Ottawa investigating sources in no particular order will allow them to draw their own conclusions 

-I think Aris looks like it would be the easiest platform to build the game. The only problem is that although I have a mac, I don’t have an iphone which makes it difficult for me to test the game.

-This also brings up issues of accessibility

-One positive in terms of accessibility is that in Aris you can toggle whether or not the player actually needs to be in the geographical location in order to play the game, this would allow players to interact with the game from home

-Taleblazer might be easier for me to actually access and test but it is far more complex in terms of actually building and as a result feels more restrictive

-I tried building essentially the same game on both platforms where you have to give an acorn to a squirrel and I was only successful in actually creating something on Aris

Dangers:

-My biggest worry in terms of this project is telling someone else’s story for them
	
  -If I talk about unceded territory, how do I tell that story without usurping the voice of Indigenous people?
	
  -If I talk about the racist comments MacDonald made in some of his speeches, how do I do that without being anachronistic in criticizing him and should I really be giving him and his words another platform?


Tech’s use in Ottawa?

-From what I can find online, most of the AR that has been created in/for Ottawa are for entertainment purposes
	
  -Pokemon Go, etc.

-Has been used in art installations 

-Anthropocene at the National Gallery

-Because we have such a dense concentration of historic sites downtown with overlapping narratives and timelines, it could be used as a very interesting interactive to help both residents and tourists investigate the history of Canada, Ontario, Ottawa, and the Algonquin
	
  -However, these types of games require a lot of walking around which just isn’t feasible for everyone, especially in the winter

Next steps:

-Play around with Aris more and figure out if I can build the game on there without being able to test it

-Also need to start digging into the research for the topic and figure out the story line\


Digital Tinkering:
Aris

-Seems much simpler than taleblazer

-Pro: can enable intractable aspects to be accessible from home, people don’t have to walk around for hours in the winter

-Con: No way to test it however, ios system, I have a mac but no iphone
