For my final devlog, I am reflecting on my peersâ€™ work. I will specifically be focusing on the Ravensbruck, Herr Obermeier chatbot. Going into the chatbot, I only knew what my peer, Sabrina, had described of the project in class. As the chatbot began I immediately had an emotional reaction. The chatbot is very effective at provoking a sense of panic, imprisonment, and confusion. The chatbot positions you as a 1940s German woman who has been accused of being a lesbian and sent to a concentration camp. You are given limited options of responses to the flood of accusations and descriptions of your punishments. After you are given a few choices to make, all of which end in punishment or death, you are given contextual information about the Ravensbruck concentration camp and the treatment of lesbians in Nazi Germany. I found the chatbot to be a very effective work of guerrilla history. Not only does it confront the user with the realities that thousands of women faced in highly personal and emotional manner but it is also subversive to the current attempts at memorializing the treatment of homosexual people during World War II. As the chatbot explains, all of the memorials are dedicated to homosexual men.
