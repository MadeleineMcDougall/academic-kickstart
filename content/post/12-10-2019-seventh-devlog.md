Things are starting to come together. The further into the research I get, the happier I am that I switched my topic. The way that the content fits into the Aris format feels so much more natural. 

I have begun uploading my repositories of historical information. I think I might be finished the On to Ottawa Trek scene. I have 4 newspaper articles and a link to the Canadian Encyclopedia entry for the work camps. As I was inserting the newspaper articles, I noticed that they had a note at the bottom saying that reproduction was prohibited. I am unsure if what I am doing constitutes reproduction. If it is reproduction, is that guerrilla or just plain old plagiarism? Right now I am justifying it to myself as guerrilla because I am liberating these primary sources from their pay walls in order to make them accessible to non-academics. 

I hope that the encyclopedia entry on work camps will give the users the context they need to understand that the newspaper articles are biased against the Trekkers. I am slightly afraid that the users will interpret the newspaper articles as having the “right” opinion about the Trek and end up siding against the Trekkers. I will be sure to include some scholarly articles about the Trek in the Further Reading section at the end of the walk. I considered adding in a panel with my own writing to further contextualize the Trek within the Great Depression but I have already inserted so much of my own voice with my choices of sources and arrangement of the tour, I fear being too self indulgent in trying to “educate” the users rather than allowing them to explore the material and form their own conclusions.

I have chosen all of my sites for the walk. I wanted all my sites to be relevant to their respective walks, but I also didn’t want them to be too obvious. For most of the sites, I chose to seek out resources that exist in downtown Ottawa for people affected by the issues championed in each walk. For example, I have placed the site for the We Demand demonstration just outside a resource centre for LGBTQ+ people and the On to Ottawa Trek is placed outside the Ottawa Mission. Others, however, just make use of the landscape of downtown. For example, the Climate March is on the corner of Confederation Park, which is along the route the marchers took but is also next to a green space. 

My next steps will be to prepare to present my paradata next class, finish my research for the rest of the walks, and test out the software. I also need to figure out why my devlogs keep appearing out of chronological order.
