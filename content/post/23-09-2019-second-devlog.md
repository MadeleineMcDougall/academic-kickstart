This week, I did a bunch of things that aren't necessarily related to each other and so would not make for a very good narrative description. So, instead, here is a bullet point list of what I tried, the issues I faced, and what I read.

Digital Tinkering

-Digital Atlas changes through github
	
  -Renamed title
	
  -Changed welcome pop-up
	
  -Played around with zoom
	
  -Added Carleton pin, played around with coordinates
	
  -Linked Digital History class website

-Issues
	
  -Coordinates are slightly off, in the neighborhood (literally) but just not quite there
	
  -Linking to the DH class website isn’t working, the first letter of url is getting cut off and I don’t know why


-Personal site (This site)
	
  -Disabled publications menu item

-Issues

  -Netlify being extremely slow, thought I had done something wrong at first
	
  -Lots of trouble customizing social media links/contact information


-Twine
	
  -Made a trial narrative to familiarize myself with the website
	
  -Very easy to use, no issues


Readings

-Augmented cities

  -AR as a tool of reconstructing the idea of a museum and deconstructing the exclusivity of those institutions
	
  -Could be used as a method of maintaining historical experiences while allowing cities to adapt to current needs
  
  -Mystery Spaces sounds like a very similar concept to what I have been thinking of for this project, more investigation needed

-Resistance in the materials & 5Spectra
	
  -Talks about how digital humanities must be continually adapted
	
  -Make technologies and the information within them more accessible, particularly to under-represented groups
